This project demonstrates the detection of deforestation areas over time using satellite imagery. The process involves comparing before and after images, applying image processing techniques such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and thresholding to highlight areas of deforestation.

The final output is visualized using heatmaps and saved as an image and CSV file for further analysis.
