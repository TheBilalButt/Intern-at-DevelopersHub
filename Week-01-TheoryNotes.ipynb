        "Machine Learning (ML) is a way to teach computers to learn from data without writing all the rules manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-life example:\n",
        "- YouTube recommends videos based on your past viewing history.\n",

        "\n",
        "We give the computer data with correct answers so it can learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "- A spam filter learns from labeled emails (spam/not spam).\n",
        "\n",
        "Includes:\n",
        "- Classification (e.g., disease prediction)\n",
        "- Regression (e.g., house price prediction)\n",

        "\n",
        "We give the computer data without labels and it finds patterns.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "- A music app groups songs based on listening patterns.\n",
