 Task 2 - Multi-Label Emotion Classification (Week 4)

This project implements a multi-label emotion recognition system using the BERT transformer model, fine-tuned on the GoEmotions dataset. The model is capable of detecting multiple emotions in a single sentence, such as joy, anger, surprise, etc. Key components include preprocessing with BertTokenizerFast, custom data collator for multi-label outputs, and evaluation using Micro-F1 and Hamming Loss metrics.

A smaller dataset was selected for faster training.
  Micro-F1 ≈ 0.56
  Hamming Loss ≈ 0.21

The code is fully written in Python and can be run in Google Colab.
 A complete walkthrough is available via Loom video presentation.
