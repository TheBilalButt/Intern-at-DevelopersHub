# Week-01  ML Theory Notes 

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a way to teach computers to learn from data without writing rules manually.

**Real-life example:**
- YouTube recommends videos based on your history.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses data with known answers to train the model.
- **Example:** Email spam filters
- Includes classification and regression.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- No correct labels are given; the model finds patterns.
- **Example:** Grouping similar products based on user behavior.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns by doing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Example:** A self-driving car learning to follow the road.

## Difference Between AI, ML, and Deep Learning

- **AI:** Machines that mimic human intelligence (e.g., Siri)
- **ML:** Machines that learn from data (e.g., Netflix recommendations)
- **DL:** A subset of ML using neural networks (e.g., face recognition)
